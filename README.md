# Tea-Cozy
The Tea Cozy is the project of Codecademy (Layout with Flexbox).
However, I havenâ€™t used Flexbox here. Instead i have focused on positioning elements using display: inline-block, float and other features supported by most of the browsers. 
HTML file has been checked in https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea
This is an adaptive page.
Focus on features:
display: inline-block, 
float,
adaptive design

The project was finished 02/03/2021 but only now uploaded
